# Kompact

A work-in-progress bookkeeping package originally written in Java (and leaning on the [TotallyLazy](https://github.com/bodar/totallylazy) functional library), but now being ported to Kotlin.

I started writing this as a way to learn how to write a 'large' application, to cement my understanding of Java, experiment with design patterns, approaches to testing etc. The fact that it would take the form of a native application (running on the Java 8 runtime) and I would learn a bit JavaFX was appealing but not essential. Though I didn't know what I was doing when I started out, I figured that the worst thing that would happen is that I would generate a big ball of legacy code that I could spend future hours refactoring (and therefore honing those skills), which is more or less what has happened.

The name is a nod to an old MS-DOS accounting package called Compact which I used for several years working in the family business. Yes! Kompact runs on Windows XP. I've tested it. We used to run Compact on Win 98, for those of you who are intested, but I won't be testing Kompact on that...
